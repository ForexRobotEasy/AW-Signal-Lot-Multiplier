## How It Works

### Copy Transactions within Same Terminal
The `CopyTransactions` function is responsible for copying transactions within the same terminal. It ensures the accuracy and security of the copied transactions and allows for the duplication or resizing of the lot when copying transactions.

### Automation of Features
The `AutomateFeatures` function automates certain features when duplicating orders from advisors. It includes code to automatically change volumes and open additional orders as required.

### Integration with Signals Service
The `IntegrateWithSignalsService` function enables seamless integration with the Signals service. It efficiently duplicates orders and executes trades based on received signals.

### Trading Functions
The following trading functions are available:

- `CopyTransactionsWithinTerminal`: Calls the `CopyTransactions` function to copy transactions within the same terminal.
- `ResizeLotSize`: Resizes the lot size accurately.
- `DuplicateOrdersFromAdvisors`: Calls the `AutomateFeatures` function to automate certain features when duplicating orders from advisors.
- `ReceiveSignalsAndExecuteTrades`: Calls the `IntegrateWithSignalsService` function to integrate with the Signals service and execute trades based on received signals.

### Main Program
The `OnStart` function is the main program that executes the required trading functions. It includes an example ticket number and lot size for the copy transactions within the same terminal. It also demonstrates resizing the lot size and duplicating orders from advisors. Finally, it integrates with the Signals service and executes trades.
